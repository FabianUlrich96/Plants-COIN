  abstract = {Electrical signals in plants play the role of biological messages. It is significant to make them understood. In order to acquire the basic characteristics of the electrical signal in corn, wavelet soft-threshold de-noising method was introduced to reduce the noise for the acquisition signals. The amplitudes of electrical signals in corn were {$\mu$}V level, and the frequencies were below 1Hz, large parts of which were lower than 0.5Hz. The amplitudes were large, and the distribution of power spectrum was stable when the environment temperature between 20\'c and 35\'c. The ratio of signal below 0.1Hz gained when the temperature was above 35\'c, while the amplitude reduced obviously. It can be considered that the disappearance of the high frequency and the reducing of the amplitudes were the signs of cell vital activity subsiding. Thus, it is possible to achieve the prediction life status according to the amplitudes and the frequencies of electrical signals in plants.},

Thus each user can contribute by sharing their geolocalised measurements and further personal annotation to produce a collective noise map.},

  abstract = {This review introduces the characteristics of electrical signals in higher plants and their corresponding physiological significance, and describes in detail the impact of environmental factors (e.g. light and temperature) on the electrical potential of the plants. Also, we evaluate the measurement techniques used for electrical signals in plants, including intracellular measurement, extracellular measurement, measurement of the ion channel based on the patch-clamp technique and on the non-invasive microelectrode vibrating probe technique. We also give a brief review of the applications of these methods for investigating electrical signals in plants. The ionic mechanism of electrical activity in plants is then discussed in terms of environmental response in higher plants, and this is used to provide a theoretical basis for quantitative description of the electrical signals in plants. A model for interpretation of the electrical signal mechanisms in higher plants is discussed, but further experiments are required for the verification of this model.},

  abstract = {The present study provides an evaluation of noise pollution in six Urban Parks located in the city of Curitiba, Brazil. Equivalent noise levels (Leq) were measured in 303 points (each point measured during 3 min) spread throughout the Parks. Measured values were confronted with local legislation (Law 10625) allowed limits, and the Parks were thus classified as ``acoustically polluted or unpolluted''. Measured values were also evaluated according to international legislation: Decree no. 12 of the City Council of Rome, DIN 18005 for German cities, the World Health Organization, and the United States Environmental Protection Agency. Urban parks in the downtown area of Curitiba, surrounded by roads of heavy traffic and in the midst of intense commercial activities, do not satisfy any of the standards used. The most noise-polluted parks in Curitiba were the Public Walk Park and the Botanical Garden Park, with measured Leq of 64.8 dB(A) and 67 dB(A).},

  abstract = {Upon herbivore attack plants react with a cascade of signals. Early events are represented by ion flux unbalances that eventually lead to plasma transmembrane potential (Vm) variations. These events are triggered by mechanical wounding implicated by chewing/piercing herbivores along with the injection of oral secretions (OS) containing plant response effectors and elicitors. Vm depolarization has been found to be a common event when plants interact with different biotrophs, and to vary depending on type and feeding habit of the biotroph. Here we show recent advances of internal and external signal trans\- duction in plant-insect interactions by analyzing the differential impact of mechanical and herbivore damage on plants. Vm variations, calcium signaling, and ROS production precede the late events represented by gene expression, proteomics, and metabolomics. Transcriptomics allows to decipher genomic expression following Vm variations and signaling upon herbivory; proteomics helps to understand. the biological function of expressed genes, whereas meta\- bolomics gives feedbacks on the combined action of gene expression and protein synthesis, by showing the complexity of plant responses through synthesis of direct and indirect plant defense molecules. The practical application of modem methods starting from signal transduction to metabolic responses to insect her\- bivory are discussed and documented.},
