# Plants-COIN
This repository is a documentation and collection of a university research project collecting and processing electrical plant signals using the [Plant SpikerBox](https://backyardbrains.com/products/plantspikerbox). In our project it is our goal to find out if, and if yes, how plants react to noise pollution.

Studied noise pollution:
- Street noise pollution
- Construction noise pollution


## Repository Structure
The repository is structured in:
1. Data Collection including the experiment setup, a script for data collection, as well as the collected data.
2. Data Processing
3. Literature Search: The used literature for our project, as well as a short summary/ the main points of interest.
